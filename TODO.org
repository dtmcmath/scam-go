This document sketches, somewhat randomly, things that need to get
done to make SCAM a thing of true beauty.

#+TOC: headlines

* Issues

** Lex errors are very cryptic

* Desiderata

** Î»

I really want a keyword "*lambda*".  With that, we could define

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(define cons
  (lambda (a b)
    (lambda (c)
      (if (eq? c 'car)
          a
          (if (eq? c 'cdr)
              b
          )
      )
    )
  )
)
(define car (lambda (c) (c 'car)))
(define cdr (lambda (c) (c 'cdr)))
#+END_SRC

** INPROGRESS Separate parse errors from evaluation errors

I need to read more about what an "error" S-expression looks like.
Right now, they just look like pretty generic Go structs.

The evaluator's errors look quite a lot like those from
[[https://cisco.github.io/ChezScheme/][Chez Scheme]] (because I copied them).  Parse errors are still a mess

** Bignums

Don't you wonder what

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

#+END_SRC

is?

* Roadmap

This section tries to put some of the developments into a sequence.

** Cons-es recycled
